# PySub20 - Python library for libsub

## Installation

Dependencies:
* Libusb-1.0
* Python 2.7 (other versions may work as well, untested)
* Swig 1.3
* gcc

In order to build PySub20 you may need to edit a few things in the 'makeswig' file, which, for now, replaces a make file

makeswig consists of the following commands:

> swig -python -outdir ./ -o ./lib/libsub_wrap.c ./lib/libsub.i

This creates the libsub wrapper and the python libsub library


> gcc -c -w -fPIC ./lib/libsub.c ./lib/libsub_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I./lib -DLIBUSB_1_0 

This compiles the libsub library and its wrapper. If your include path for Python is different from /usr/include/python2.7 you will need to change it.

> gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,libsub.so -lusb-1.0 -o _libsub.so ./lib/libsub.o ./lib/libsub_wrap.o

Creates the shared library which is used by the Python library. If your library reference is called something different from usb-1.0 then change it.

Once built, just use the folder as a module in your application or add it to your Python path, in leu of a distutils setup.
